 * @brief Similiar to state of the art photogrammetry software REALM is designed as pipeline. The idea behind the
 * pipeline architecture is to break down the complex problem into several independent steps. Similiar to a conveyor
 * images are transported from one step (stage) to another doing all the possible processing work and then moving on.
 * One basic example might be: ImageCapturing -> PoseEstimation -> Densification -> OrthoGeneration -> Visualization
 * These 5 stages can and should be processed in a seperate thread each, which are also independent from the
 * communication infrastructure (e.g. ROS). So if we have 5 steps in the pipeline, each step should have one thread
 * that does the communication work and feeds the data into the second thread which does the processing. This class
 * provides and abstract for the latter one. Each stage should implement the stage class, which in turn takes care
 * of thread handling like start, stop, reset without conflicting with the communication thread feeding data.
